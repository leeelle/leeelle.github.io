		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

		<p>I’m inspired by design firm <a href="http://www.wolffolins.com/" target="_blank">Wolff Olins</a> website and politics section for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>.</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

		<p>For Wolff Olins, since they have very bright yellow brand color, I can see they try to incorporate their yellow into the website as minimalized but still catching people’s eye. This website is a good example of uses of negative spaces while lots of animations are loading even on hover states. They are balanced very well with size of text and space as well.</p>

		<p>For Bloomberg Politics website, it’s great to see the editorial feelings on screen throughout whole page. While their website handles lots of information/articles, they give breathing rooms between the blocks and organize well based on the grid system.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

		<p>It makes look similar since they both use blocks with hairlines. But when you move over on the articles, Wolff Olins use lots of animation to give active and liberate feeling to the user. When you scroll down on Bloomberg page, they focused on more organized information rather than interacting with people. Both website are well designed for their own purpose.</p>

				<p>They have a very simple grid system and play with visual elements – text size, color and etc. Focal point is very straight forward because they use very bright yellow color on their logo.</p>

				<p>
				<li><strong>Bloomberg Politics</strong>
				</p>
				<img src="wireframe_Bloomberg.jpg">

				<p>While they don’t use much color and size on the landing page, the logo could be given a power as a focal point. Each articles have different space according to the hierarchy.</p>
